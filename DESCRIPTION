Title: Create dotplots of genomic sequences to visualise similarity.

Description: This package produces sequence similarity dotplots for inspecting
    various properties of sequences or between sequences. It uses an efficient
    C++ implementation for calculating the similarity matrix and ggplot for
    producing the output. This implementation incidentally uses a sparse 
    representation of the similarity matrix as required by ggplot, making it
    much more scalable than dense matrix implementations.
